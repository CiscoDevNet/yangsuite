Constructing and populating a YANG module repository
====================================================

1. From the sidebar on any YANG Suite page, select
   `"Setup → YANG files and repositories" </filemanager/repository/manage/>`_.

2. Select "New repository," enter a name for this repository
   in the dialog that opens, and select "Create repository."

3. Once the page refreshes to display your new repository,
   there are a number of different ways to populate it with YANG modules
   (also known as YANG models, YANG schemas, or YANG files):

   .. toctree::
      :maxdepth: 2

      upload_schemas
      download_schemas
      scp_schemas
      git_schemas

4. Regardless of methodology, whenever the repository's contents change,
   YANG suite will run sanity checks against the modules in the repository
   and report the results to you in the "Repository status" section to
   the right of the page.

   If, for example, you have added modules that have dependencies on other
   modules, and said other modules are not also present in the repository,
   YANG suite will detect these missing dependencies and warn you that
   these dependencies need to be added as well.

            from the YANG repository

5. The left side of the page lists the contents of the currently selected
   repository. You can choose to select and delete schemas from the repository
   by using the appropriate labeled buttons.

6. When you are happy with the contents of your repository, you can proceed
   to the :doc:`define_yangset` documentation.
