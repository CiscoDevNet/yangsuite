Section 1. Scope and Applicability

This End User License Agreement (“EULA”) between You and Cisco covers Your use of the Software and Cloud Services (“Cisco Technology”). This document also incorporates any Product Specific Terms that may apply to the Cisco Technology You acquire. Definitions of capitalized terms are in Section 13 (Definitions).

You agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA through (a) Your download, installation, or use of the Cisco Technology; or (b) Your express agreement to this EULA.
If You do not have authority to enter into this EULA or You do not agree with its terms, do not use the Cisco Technology. You may request a refund for the Software within 30 days of Your initial purchase provided You return the Software to the Approved Source and disable or uninstall it. This paragraph does not apply where You have expressly agreed to end user license terms with Cisco as part of a transaction with an Approved Source.

Section 2. Using Cisco Technology

2.1. License and Right to Use. Cisco grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable (except with respect to Software as permitted under the https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/legal/policy/Cisco_Software_Transfer_and_Relicensing_Policy.pdf) (a) license to use the Software; and (b) right to use the Cloud Services, both as acquired from an Approved Source, for Your direct benefit during the Usage Term and as set out in Your Entitlement and this EULA (collectively, the “Usage Rights”).

2.2. Use by Third Parties. You may permit Authorized Third Parties to exercise the Usage Rights on Your behalf, provided that You are responsible for (a) ensuring that such Authorized Third Parties comply with this EULA and (b) any breach of this EULA by such Authorized Third Parties.

2.3. Beta and Trial Use. If Cisco grants You Usage Rights in the applicable Cisco Technology on a trial, evaluation, beta or other free-of-charge basis (“Evaluation Software and Services”), You may only use the Evaluation Software and Services on a temporary basis for the period limited by the license key or specified by Cisco in writing.  If there is no period identified, such use is limited to 30 days after the Evaluation Software and Services are made available to You.  If You fail to stop using and/or return the Evaluation Software and Services or the equipment on which it is authorized for use by the end of the trial period, You may be invoiced for its list price and agree to pay such invoice.  Cisco, in its discretion, may stop providing the Evaluation Software and Services at any time, at which point You will no longer have access to any related data, information, and files and must immediately cease using the Cisco Technology.  The Evaluation Software and Services may not have been subject to Cisco’s usual testing and quality assurance processes and may contain bugs, errors, or other issues.  Except where agreed to in writing by Cisco, You will not put Evaluation Software and Services into production use.  Cisco provides Evaluation Software and Services “AS-IS” without support or any express or implied warranty or indemnity for any problems or issues, and Cisco will not have any liability relating to Your use of the Evaluation Software and Services.

2.4. Upgrades or Additional Copies of Software. You may only use Upgrades or additional copies of the Software beyond Your license Entitlement if You have (a) acquired such rights under a support agreement covering the applicable Software; or (b) You have purchased the right to use Upgrades or additional copies separately.

2.5. Interoperability of Software. If required by law and upon Your request, Cisco will provide You with the information needed to achieve interoperability between the Software and another independently created program, provided You agree to any additional terms reasonably required by Cisco. You will treat such information as Confidential Information.

2.6. Subscription Renewal.  Usage Rights in Cisco Technology acquired on a subscription basis will automatically renew for the renewal period indicated on the order You or Your Cisco Partner placed with Cisco (“Renewal Term”) unless: (a) You notify Your Approved Source in writing at least 45 days before the end of Your then-current Usage Term of Your intention not to renew; or (b) You or Your Cisco Partner elect not to auto-renew at the time of the initial order placed with Cisco. Your Approved Source will notify You reasonably in advance of any Renewal Term if there are fee changes. The new fees will apply for the upcoming Renewal Term unless You or Your Cisco Partner promptly notify Cisco in writing, before the renewal date, that You do not accept the fee changes. In that case, Your subscription will terminate at the end of the current Usage Term.

Section 3. Additional Conditions of Use

3.1. Cisco Technology Generally. Unless expressly agreed by Cisco, You may not (a) transfer, sell, sublicense, monetize or make the functionality of any Cisco Technology available to any third party; (b) use the Software on second hand or refurbished Cisco equipment not authorized by Cisco, or use Software that is licensed for a specific device on a different device (except as permitted under https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/legal/policy/Software_License_Portability_Policy_FINAL.pdf); (c) remove, modify, or conceal any product identification, copyright, proprietary, intellectual property notices or other marks; (d) reverse engineer, decompile, decrypt, disassemble, modify, or make derivative works of the Cisco Technology; or (e) use Cisco Content other than as part of Your permitted use of the Cisco Technology. 

3.2. Cloud Services. You will not intentionally (a) interfere with other customers’ access to, or use of, the Cloud Service, or with its security; (b) facilitate the attack or disruption of the Cloud Service, including a denial of service attack, unauthorized access, penetration testing, crawling, or distribution of malware (including viruses, trojan horses, worms, time bombs, spyware, adware, and cancelbots); (c) cause an unusual spike or increase in Your use of the Cloud Service that negatively impacts the Cloud Service’s operation; or (d) submit any information that is not contemplated in the applicable Documentation.

3.3. Evolving Cisco Technology. Cisco may: (a) enhance or refine a Cloud Service, although in doing so, Cisco will not materially reduce the core functionality of that Cloud Service, except as contemplated in this Section; and (b) perform scheduled maintenance of the infrastructure and software used to provide a Cloud Service, during which time You may experience some disruption to that Cloud Service.  Whenever reasonably practicable, Cisco will provide You with advance notice of such maintenance.  You acknowledge that, from time to time, Cisco may need to perform emergency maintenance without providing You advance notice, during which time Cisco may temporarily suspend Your access to, and use of, the Cloud Service. 

Cisco may end the life of Cisco Technology, including component functionality (“EOL”), by providing written notice on Cisco.com. If You or Your Cisco Partner prepaid a fee for Your use of the Cisco Technology that becomes EOL before the expiration of Your then-current Usage Term, Cisco will use commercially reasonable efforts to transition You to a substantially similar Cisco Technology. If Cisco does not have substantially similar Cisco Technology, then Cisco will credit You or Your Cisco Partner any unused portion of the prepaid fee for the Cisco Technology that has been declared EOL (“EOL Credit”).  The EOL Credit will be calculated from the last date the applicable Cisco Technology is available to the last date of the applicable Usage Term.  Such credit can be applied towards the future purchase of Cisco products.

3.4. Protecting Account Access. You will keep all account information up to date, use reasonable means to protect Your account information, passwords and other login credentials, and promptly notify Cisco of any known or suspected unauthorized use of or access to Your account. 

3.5. Use with Third-Party Products. If You use the Cisco Technology together with third-party products, such use is at Your risk.  You are responsible for complying with any third-party provider terms, including its privacy policy.  Cisco does not provide support or guarantee ongoing integration support for products that are not a native part of the Cisco Technology.

3.6. Open Source Software. Open source software not owned by Cisco is subject to separate license terms as set out at http://www.cisco.com/go/opensource. The applicable open source software licences will not materially or adversely affect Your ability to exercise Usage Rights in applicable Cisco Technology.

Section 4. Fees

To the extent permitted by law, orders for the Cisco Technology are non-cancellable. Fees for Your use of Cisco Technology are set out in Your purchase terms with Your Approved Source.  If You use Cisco Technology beyond Your Entitlement (“Overage”), the Approved Source may invoice You, and You agree to pay, for such Overage.

Section 5. Confidential Information and Use of Data

5.1. Confidentiality. Recipient will hold in confidence and use no less than reasonable care to avoid disclosure of any Confidential Information to any third party, except for its employees, affiliates, and contractors who have a need to know (“Permitted Recipients”). Recipient: (a) must ensure that its Permitted Recipients are subject to written confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than the Recipient’s obligations under this EULA, and (b) is liable for any breach of this Section by its Permitted Recipients.  Such nondisclosure obligations will not apply to information that: (i) is known by Recipient without confidentiality obligations; (ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of Recipient; or (iii) is independently developed by Recipient. Recipient may disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information if required under a regulation, law or court order provided that Recipient provides prior notice to Discloser (to the extent legally permissible) and reasonably cooperates, at Discloser’s expense, regarding protective actions pursued by Discloser. Upon the reasonable request of Discloser, Recipient will either return, delete or destroy all Confidential Information of Discloser and certify the same.

Section 6. Ownership

Except where agreed in writing, nothing in this EULA transfers ownership in, or grants any license to, any intellectual property rights.  You retain any ownership of Your content and Cisco retains ownership of the Cisco Technology and Cisco Content. Cisco may use any feedback You provide in connection with Your use of the Cisco Technology as part of its business operations.   

Section 7. Indemnification

7.1. Claims. Cisco will defend any third-party claim against You that Your valid use of Cisco Technology under Your Entitlement infringes a third party's patent, copyright or registered trademark (the “IP Claim”). Cisco will indemnify You against the final judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction or any settlements arising out of an IP Claim, provided that You: (a) promptly notify Cisco in writing of the IP Claim; (b) fully cooperate with Cisco in the defense of the IP Claim; and (c) grant Cisco the right to exclusively control the defense and settlement of the IP Claim, and any subsequent appeal. Cisco will have no obligation to reimburse You for attorney fees and costs incurred prior to Cisco's receipt of notification of the IP Claim. You, at Your own expense, may retain Your own legal representation.

7.2. Additional Remedies. If an IP Claim is made and prevents Your exercise of the Usage Rights, Cisco will either procure for You the right to continue using the Cisco Technology or replace or modify the Cisco Technology with functionality that is at least equivalent. Only if Cisco determines that these alternatives are not reasonably available, Cisco may terminate Your Usage Rights granted under this EULA upon written notice to You and will refund You a prorated portion of the fee You paid for the Cisco Technology for the remainder of the unexpired Usage Term.

7.3. Exclusions.  Cisco has no obligation with respect to any IP Claim based on: (a) compliance with any designs, specifications, or requirements You provide or a third party provides on Your behalf; (b) Your modification of any Cisco Technology or modification by a third party; (c) the amount or duration of use made of the Cisco Technology, revenue You earned, or services You offered; (d) combination, operation, or use of Cisco Technology with non-Cisco products, software or business processes; (e) Your failure to modify or replace Cisco Technology as required by Cisco; or (f) any Cisco Technology provided on a no charge, beta or evaluation basis.

Section 8. Warranties and Representations

8.1. Performance. Cisco warrants that: (a) for a period of 90 days from the Delivery Date or longer as stated in Documentation, or on www.cisco.com/go/warranty, the Software substantially complies with the Documentation; and (b) during the Usage Term, it provides the Cloud Services with commercially reasonable skill and care in accordance with the Documentation and Product Specific Terms.

8.2. Malicious Code. Cisco will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the Cisco Technology free of Malicious Code.

8.3. Qualifications. Sections 8.1 and 8.2 do not apply if the Cisco Technology or the equipment on which it is authorized for use: (a) has been altered, except by Cisco or its authorized representative; (b) has been subjected to abnormal physical conditions, accident or negligence, or installation or use inconsistent with this EULA or Cisco’s instructions; (c) is acquired on a no charge, beta or evaluation basis; (d) is not a Cisco-branded product or service; or (e) has not been provided by an Approved Source. Upon Your prompt written notification to the Approved Source during the warranty period of Cisco’s breach of this Section 8, Your sole and exclusive remedy (unless otherwise required by applicable law) is, at Cisco’s option, either (i) repair or replacement of the applicable Cisco Technology or (ii) a refund of the (a) license fees paid or due for the non-conforming Software, or (b) the fees paid for the period in which the Cloud Service did not comply, excluding any amounts paid under a service level agreement/objective, if applicable.  

Where Cisco provides a refund of license fees paid for Software, You must return or destroy all copies of the applicable Software. Except as expressly stated in this Section, to the extent allowed by applicable law, Cisco expressly disclaims all warranties and conditions of any kind, express or implied, including without limitation any warranty, condition or other implied term as to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement, or that the Cisco Technology will be secure, uninterrupted or error free.

Section 9. Liability

Neither party will be liable for indirect, incidental, exemplary, special or consequential damages; loss or corruption of data or interruption or loss of business; or loss of revenues, profits, goodwill or anticipated sales or savings. The maximum aggregate liability of each party under this EULA is limited to (a) for claims solely arising from Software licensed on a perpetual basis, the fees received by Cisco for that Software; or (b) for all other claims, the fees received by Cisco for the applicable Cisco Technology and attributable to the 12 month period immediately preceding the first event giving rise to such liability.

These limitations of liability do not apply to liability arising from (a) Your failure to pay all amounts due; or (b) Your breach of Sections 2.1 (License and Right to Use), 3.1 (Cisco Technology Generally), 3.2 (Cloud Services) or 12.8 (Export). This limitation of liability applies whether the claims are in warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), infringement, or otherwise, even if either party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Nothing in this EULA limits or excludes any liability that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable law. This limitation of liability is cumulative and not per incident. 

Section 10. Termination and Suspension

10.1. Suspension. Cisco may immediately suspend Your Usage Rights if You breach Sections 2.1 (License and Right to Use), 3.1 (Cisco Technology Generally), 3.2 (Cloud Services) or 12.8 (Export). 

10.2. Termination.

Upon Cisco’s termination of this EULA for Your material breach, You will pay Cisco or the Approved Source any unpaid fees through to the end of the then-current Usage Term. If You continue to use or access any Cisco Technology after termination, Cisco or the Approved Source may invoice You, and You agree to pay, for such continued use.

Section 11. Verification

During the Usage Term and for a period of 12 months after its expiry or termination, You will take reasonable steps to maintain complete and accurate records of Your use of the Cisco Technology sufficient to verify compliance with this EULA (“Verification Records”). Upon reasonable advance notice, and no more than once per 12 month period, You will, within 30 days from Cisco’s notice, allow Cisco and its auditors access to the Verification Records and any applicable books, systems (including Cisco product(s) or other equipment), and accounts during Your normal business hours. If the verification process discloses underpayment of fees: (a) You will pay such fees; and (b) You will also pay the reasonable cost of the audit if the fees owed to Cisco as a result exceed the amounts You paid for Your Usage Rights by more than 5%.
