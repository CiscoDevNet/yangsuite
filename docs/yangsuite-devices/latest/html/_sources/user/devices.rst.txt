Managing device profiles
========================

Defining a device profile
-------------------------

1. From the sidebar on any YANG Suite page, select
   `"Setup → Device profiles" </devices/devprofile/>`_.
2. On the newly loaded page, select "New Profile."
   A form will appear for you to enter the device information into.
3. Enter a name for this device profile.
4. Fill in all of the required fields under "General device information."
   The address, username, and password you enter here will be used as
   default values for any specific connection method (SSH, NETCONF, etc.).
5. For "Device supports the following," check all of the connection methods
   that your device supports (SSH, NETCONF, etc.)
6. Each of these methods will use method-specific defaults
   (e.g., port 22 for SSH) plus the parameters you entered under
   "General device information." If you want to change any of these defaults,
   select the appropriate tab (such as "NETCONF")
   to display its options, and make changes as needed to override the
   inherited defaults.
7. Once this is done, you may use the "Check connectivity" button
   to confirm that the device is reachable by ping and
   by the access mode(s) you have enabled.
   This will take a moment then report the results of this check.
   If any checks failed, you should investigate to determine why
   and make corrections to the device profile as needed.
8. Once you are satisfied that the device profile is properly
   defined, select "Save new device profile" to save this profile.
9. You can now use this saved profile wherever YANG Suite requires one,
   such as downloading YANG modules from a device or sending NETCONF RPCs
   to a device.

Managing existing device profiles
---------------------------------

From the same `"Setup → Device profiles" </devices/devprofile/>`_ page,
you can manage the existing device profiles. Select any device profile from
the list on the right side of the page, and you can then re-check its
connectivity, make changes to it, clone it into a new device profile, or
delete it if no longer needed.
